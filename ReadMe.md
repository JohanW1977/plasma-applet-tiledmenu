# Tiled Menu

https://store.kde.org/p/2142716/

A menu based on Windows 10's Start Menu.

* Supports:
    * Pin/Favourite apps/files through the context menu (or by dragging them from dolphin).
    * Resizing (permanently) the size of the menu by Meta + Right Clicking and dragging.
    * Any size tile 1x1, 2x2, 4x4, 4x2, 1x3, etc.
    * Easily edit the background image of a tile.
    * Customizable sidebar shortcuts.
    * Jump to Letter/Category (can also default to this view)
    * Defaulting to only showing the tiles.
    * Labeling Groups of Tiles + Move Groups of Tiles + Sorting items in the group
* Does not support (Win10):
    * Tile Groups ("Folders")
      
## Bugs

* If "Icons" are selected for the tiles, the size is to big, and won't resize to fit the tilesize. jpg's/png do resize fine.
* Search wil always be on top (even when on top is disabled in the settings)
* When you modify something in the settings, the font/letter size in de 'applist' will reset to 36px
* Modifying the width of the applist window (alfabetical/cathegories) is ok, but the with of the edit tiles window will not follow the with (it's in the sam window)
* "Tiles only" works, but the pannel width remains the same. It should Shrink to the max. width
