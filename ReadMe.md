# Tiled Menu

https://store.kde.org/p/2142716/

A menu based on Windows 10's Start Menu.

* Supports:
    * Pin/Favourite apps/files through the context menu (or by dragging them from dolphin).
    * Resizing (permanently) the size of the menu by Meta + Right Clicking and dragging.
    * Any size tile 1x1, 2x2, 4x4, 4x2, 1x3, etc.
    * Easily edit the background image of a tile.
    * Customizable sidebar shortcuts.
    * Jump to Letter/Category (can also default to this view)
    * Defaulting to only showing the tiles.
    * Labeling Groups of Tiles + Move Groups of Tiles + Sorting items in the group
* Does not support (Win10):
    * Tile Groups ("Folders")
      
## Bugs

* Search wil always be on top (even when on top is disabled in the settings).
* Switching between "Alphabetical" / "Cathegories" / "Tiles only" initially works, but the pannel width doesn't update after reboot . It should Shrink to the max. width.
* On my Intel UHD 630 sometimes the menu scales badly (with external monitor and dockingstation) > Driver issue??

## Still To Add
* Group Tiles.
* When dragging tiles over grid, other tiles should 'make place / move' for dragged tile.
